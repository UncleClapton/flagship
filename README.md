Flagship App™ is a toolkit for building and scaling an ecommerce experience that comprises several packages. Flagship App™ can be used independently of Flagship Code™.

The toolkit includes a shared stack of foundation packages that provide a unified interface for networking, analytics, commerce integrations, components, and more across each of the supported platforms. 

The foundation packages provide a normalization over their integrations, and higher-level modules do not need to implement platform-specific code. These foundation packages are built on top of one another to provide an efficient and seamless development experience.
