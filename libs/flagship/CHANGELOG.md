### chore

- merge develop into master ([#838](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/838)) (1bb87b2), closes [#620](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/620) [#817](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/817) [#814](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/814) [#823](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/823) [#808](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/808) [#143](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/143) [#862](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/862) [#864](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/864) [#877](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/877) [#878](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/878) [#867](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/867) [#898](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/898) [#906](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/906) [#905](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/905)

### Features

- implement react-native-permissions v2 support (e017806)
- **flagship:** RNDiff updates for RN63 (63b22b3)
- remove hockeyapp and update appcenter for fastlane (839cb59)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- This upgrades react-native-permissions from v1 to v2 and adds config support for adding the appropriate pods and permissions to the ios and android projects. Permissions v2 has a new API that will require changes for existing implementations.

Usage of the library is described in their repo: <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-permissions#methods>

- **flagship:** upgrade to react-native-navigation 6
  Should not affect most cases.
  <https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes>

Fixes issues with tab bar icons not showing up in iOS 14.

- This removes the apiToken env config that could be used to configure App Center uploads. This was previously deprecated in favor of passing in an environment variable instead: APPCENTER_API_TOKEN.

This also removes the :beta lanes from the Fastfiles, as these attempted to upload builds to Hockeyapp which has been shut down. The available lanes are :appcenter and :build for iOS and :appcenter, :appcenter_bundle, and :build for Android.

- If anything hard codes the android native project path (ie.
  android/app/src/main/java/com/brandingbrand/reactnative/and/project-name), it will need to be
  updated to account for the dynamic package name. Flagship now exports its own modules, so
  `flagship.path.android.nativeProjectPath(config)` can be used to get the directory without hard
  coding a path.

- Revert yarn.lock changes

- feat: update bv components w/ syndicated indicator

### BREAKING CHANGES

- splash screens will need to be converted to storyboards

- feat: update fsapp to use react-native-navigation 2

- Use global event handlers for popToRoot on tab press for Android and restoring screen on load
  option
- Add requirement for tabs to have ids

- Tabs must now have ids defined in their configuration

- feat: update pirateship to use react-native-navigation 2

- refactor: Use react native community version of AsyncStorage

- feat(fsengagement): add new zones

- fix: fix codepush integration with RNN v2

- fix(fsapp): RNN v2 allow passing static styling as a function

RNN v2 by default is passing static styling as a function so passProps info can be included. Updated to support the default behavior. This is not breaking the backward-compatible logic

- feat(fsengagement): add gridwall and product carousel

- feat(fsengagement): cache last update + add isNew flag to each message
- This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

- chore: ensure android ci step uses node 10
- This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

For usage instructions, see the new wiki article: <https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/wiki/Signing-Your-Apps>

- chore: pin react-native-sensitive-info to 5.4.x

- feat(fscomponents): support more styling options for MultiCarousel

- feat(fscomponents): add hideZoomButton props to ZoomCarousel

- fix: Add 'Marquis' feature to Button with title dynamically reflecting CTA state

- chore(fscomponents): add missing typedef to modalhalfscreen component

- fix(flagship): update string replace to work in new fastfile

- fix: get default env from initial script

- build: upgrade deprecated webpack dev server

- fix(flagship): fix fastlane build lane

Added missing xcargs flags that tells xcode to make an unprovisioned build when "fastlane build" is executed.

- chore: tell greenkeeper to ignore more dependencies
  react, metro-react-babel-preset, and babel should only be updated as part of coordinated React Native upgrades.
- This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

- fix(flagship): Latest react-native-payments and react-native-swiper

Also:

- added supportLibVersion to the gradle file
- advises what to do instead of calling setOnNavigatorEvent
- fix for NativeModules.StatusBarManager.HEIGHT
- fix for instances.filter being called on an object instead of an array

- chore: empty commit to restart coveralls

- chore(release): publish v8.0.0

- fix(flagship): Updated modules and fixed pirateship Android

Jetifier doesn't run on hoisted modules, so this makes @brandingbrand/react-native-payments get updated. Also updated path-to-regexp to v6, react-native-svg to v10, react-native-webview to v8, react-native-video to 5, and removed the unused uglifyjs-webpack-plugin. Also updated all packages to the latest in-range version, excluding the @babel modules and modules that have it as a higher-versioned dependency, such as the @storybook modules.

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-59 Updating To Function Component

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-58 Updating To Function Component

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-60 Updating To Function Component

- feat(fscomponents): Add formik, yup to fscomponents and LoginForm

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-63 - Updating To Function Component

- fix(flagship): Run react-native link to link assets

Assets like fonts need to be linked so the application will have access to them.

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-50 Update to a function component

- refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-49 - Make AddressForm a function component
- This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

- **flagship:** Make android namespace match package name ([e53e362](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/e53e362))

### Features

- android init config ([d5ef942](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/d5ef942))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **flagship:** If anything hard codes the android native project path (ie.
  android/app/src/main/java/com/brandingbrand/reactnative/and/project-name), it will need to be
  updated to account for the dynamic package name. Flagship now exports its own modules, so
  `flagship.path.android.nativeProjectPath(config)` can be used to get the directory without hard
  coding a path.
